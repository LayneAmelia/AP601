    "text": "“Boston University is an international, comprehensive, private research university, committed to educating students to be reflective, resourceful individuals ready to live, adapt, and lead in an interconnected world. Boston University is committed to generating new knowledge to benefit society.” BU Mission Statement\nBU is an institution centered around students and education. Every year, a new cohort with new ideas and experiences matriculates, and every year a cohort of fresh content experts graduates. The constantly evolving student body guides the trajectory of the institution.\n\nTuition and Aid\nI was an undergraduate in 2022 when the “largest tuition hike in 14 years” was met with upset, frustration, and despair. However, this graph reveals what is essentially a linear increase in tuition. Of course, a 4% increase of an increasing significant amount of money hits students harder each year, but this graph shows maintenance of the status quo.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\n\nstu_aid &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.Aid.02.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nstu_aid &lt;- stu_aid %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Year = as.integer(Year),\n    `Average Aid` = as.numeric(`Average Aid`),\n    `Percent Given Aid` = as.numeric(`Percent Given Aid`),\n    `Total Tuition` = as.numeric(Total),\n    Percent_Scaled = `Percent Given Aid` * 900\n  )\n\nlong_data &lt;- stu_aid %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Average Aid\", \"Total Tuition\", \"Percent_Scaled\"),\n               names_to = \"Metric\",\n               values_to = \"Value\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Metric = case_when(\n    Metric == \"Average Aid\" ~ \"Average Aid\",\n    Metric == \"Total Tuition\" ~ \"Total Tuition\",\n    Metric == \"Percent_Scaled\" ~ \"Percent Given Aid\"\n  ))\n\np &lt;- ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Metric, group = Metric,\n                           text = paste(\"Year:\", Year,\n                                        \"&lt;br&gt;Value:\", \n                                        ifelse(Metric == \"Percent Given Aid\", \n                                               scales::percent(Value / 900, scale = 1), \n                                               scales::label_dollar()(Value))))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Student Aid Overview (2002–2023)\",\n       subtitle = \"Solid lines: Aid & Tuition | Dashed line: % Receiving Aid\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Amount in Dollars\",\n       color = \"Metric\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Average Aid\" = \"#006400\",    \n    \"Total Tuition\" = \"#002366\",    \n    \"Percent Given Aid\" = \"#c9b1c9\" \n  )) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar(prefix = \"$\", big.mark = \",\"))\n\ninteractive_plot &lt;- ggplotly(p, tooltip = \"text\")\n\ninteractive_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the university expanded their financial aid program to meet all demonstrated need for first-year domestic students in the fall of 2020. Interestingly, there is limited change in the percent of students given aid and the average aid amount. The average aid number represents “federal, state, local or institutional grant aid awarded to full-time first-time undergraduates,” so while full-demonstrated need is an excellent guarantee for students, it appears this was not a financial investment on the university and on average students did not benefit.\n\n\nRacial Demographics\nIn 2009, the race categorizations changed. This affirms that race is a social construct that groups people arbitrarily— NOT based on scientific, genetic, or cultural facts.\nThe data between 1994 and 2007 group students into the following race categories:\n\nWhite Non-Hispanic\nBlack Non-Hispanic\nHispanic\nAsian or Pacific Islander\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\nRace/Ethnicity Unknown\n\nThere was a transition in categorization in 2008 and 2009, followed by a full implementation of the new race/ethnicity categories in 2010:\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native\nAsian\nBlack or African American\nHispanic\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander\nWhite\nTwo or More Races\nRace/Ethnicity Unknown\n\nInterestingly, the 1994 model leads with white, while the 2010 model is alphabetical. This is a small, but difficult to ignore detail.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\nlibrary(viridis)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.Rac.94.csv\")\n\nundergrad &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Year = `...1`,\n         AIAN = `Undergraduate AIAN`,\n         Asian = `Undergraduate Asian`,\n         Black = `Undergraduate Black`,\n         Hispanic = `Undergraduate Hispanic`,\n         NHPI = `Undergraduate NHPI`,\n                Unknown = `Undergraduate Unknown`,\n         White = `Undergraduate White`,\n         TwoOrMore = `Undergraduate Two`) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Year)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(-Year, as.numeric)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent = Count / sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)\n\nUG &lt;- ggplot(undergrad, aes(x = as.integer(Year), y = Percent, fill = Group)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8 , size = 0, colour = \"white\") +\n    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"viridis\") + \n  labs(title = \"Undergraduate Racial/Ethnic Composition Over Time\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Percent\", fill = \"Group\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\nggplotly(UG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\nlibrary(viridis)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.Rac.94.csv\")\n\ngrad &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Year = `...1`,\n         AIAN = `Graduate AIAN`,\n         Asian = `Graduate Asian`,\n         Black = `Graduate Black`,\n         Hispanic = `Graduate Hispanic`,\n         NHPI = `Graduate NHPI`,\n                Unknown = `Graduate Unknown`,\n         White = `Graduate White`,\n         TwoOrMore = `Undergraduate Two`) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Year)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(-Year, as.numeric)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent = Count / sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)\n\nUG &lt;- ggplot(grad, aes(x = as.integer(Year), y = Percent, fill = Group)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8 , size = 0, colour = \"white\") +\n    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"viridis\") + \n  labs(title = \"Graduate Racial/Ethnic Composition Over Time\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Percent\", fill = \"Group\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\nggplotly(UG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother observation is that the number of unknown students decreased during this change, implying that the race of these students was never really “Unknown,” just unrepresented.\nOver time, Boston University’s undergraduate and graduate populations have had greater numbers of students from minoritized groups. This more diverse student body enriches our campus and brings new perspectives and knowledge to the classroom and community. However, this dataset only goes to 2023. On October 15th, 2024, BU replaced the “Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Policy” in order to comply with the results of the Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina court cases:\n“Boston University recognizes that non-discrimination does not ensure that equal opportunity is a reality. Accordingly, the University will continue to take affirmative action to achieve equal opportunity through recruitment, outreach, and internal reviews of policies and practices.”\nAs a result of eliminating this policy, the number of black students enrolled in the class of 2028 dropped from 9% to 3%. The United States is at a turning point in higher education, and the data that has yet to be collected will be immensely revealing.\nAlso, there is a noted difference in the population of the undergraduate vs graduate student body in 2023, where the number of students in graduate programs who identify as Asian, Black, and Hispanic are lower in each category than the proportion of the undergraduate population. This demonstrates the leaky pipeline, where representation decreases as we go up through levels of education.\n\n\nInternational Population\nBoston University is the 5th most international school in the United States, with 22% of the total population in 2023 being international students.\n\nThe New School (34%)\nNew York University (26%)\nCarnegie Mellon University (23%)\nUniversity of Rochester (23%)\nBoston University (22%)\n\nThe diverse and global identity of BU has been long standing, and it is an element that the institution prides itself in.\n“BU is already a leader in global engagement, with a deserved reputation as a world-class research university that welcomes gifted students from every corner of the earth.” BU Strategic Plan\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\nlibrary(viridis)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.Rac.94.csv\")\n\nundergrad &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Year = `...1`,\n         Total = `Undergraduate Total`,\n         International = `Undergraduate International`) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Year)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Domestic = Total - International) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Domestic, International), names_to = \"Category\", values_to = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent = Count / sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)\n\nUG_resident_nonresident &lt;- ggplot(undergrad, aes(x = as.integer(Year), y = Percent, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8, size = 0, colour = \"white\") +  \n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") + \n  labs(title = \"Undergrad Domestic vs International Students Over Time\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Percent\", fill = \"Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\nggplotly(UG_resident_nonresident)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\nlibrary(viridis)\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.Rac.94.csv\")\n\ngrad &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Year = `...1`,\n         Total = `Graduate Total`,\n         International = `Graduate International`) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Year)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Domestic = Total - International) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Domestic, International), names_to = \"Category\", values_to = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percent = Count / sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE) * 100)\n\nG_resident_nonresident &lt;- ggplot(grad, aes(x = as.integer(Year), y = Percent, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8, size = 0, colour = \"white\") + \n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") + \n  labs(title = \"Graduate Domestic vs International Students Over Time\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Percent\", fill = \"Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n\nggplotly(G_resident_nonresident)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of international students has remained relatively consistent, with marginal increases over time. However, the university will need to adjust as the country becomes more hostile to our international community. To be able to see the trends thus far through data visualization, we will be able to clearly represent the impact that administrative changes from the federal government have on the university in a range of capacities. Yet, the fact that BU is a global, international, and diverse institution cannot be understated.\n\n\nMajors\nCIP Codes are part of the Classification of Instructional Programs system. There are 61 2 digit codes, and then additional 4 digit codes that provide specificity.\nAs an example, a BA in Computer Science from BU has the code 11.0701, which 11 marking the Computer and Information Sciences field.\nBelow, I will analyze the following codes for degree completions each year.\n\n09 - Communication and Journalism\n11 - Computer and Information Sciences\n13 - Education\n14 - Engineering\n16 - Foreign Languages, Literatures, Linguistics\n23 - English Language and Literature\n26 - Biological and Biomedical Sciences\n27 - Mathematics and Statistics\n38 - Philosophy and Religious Studies\n40 - Physical Sciences\n42 - Psychology\n45 - Social Sciences\n50 - Visual and Performing Arts\n52 - Business, Management, Marketing\n\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\n\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.CID.01.csv\")\n\nbachelor_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Year, contains(\"Bachelor\"))\n\nbachelor_long &lt;- bachelor_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  separate(Group, into = c(\"Gender\", \"Degree\", \"Field\"), sep = \"\\\\. \") %&gt;%\n  filter(Degree == \"Bachelor\")\nCIDPLOT &lt;- ggplot(bachelor_long, aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = Gender)) +\n  geom_line(size = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n  \"Women\" = \"#905acd\",\n  \"Men\" = \"#20B2AA\" \n)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Field, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bachelor Degrees by Field and Gender\",\n       y = \"Number of Degrees\",\n       x = \"Year\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\nggplotly(CIDPLOT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany degree programs have a significant underrepresentation of men and women. Men are notably underrepresented in the arts, communications/journalism, education, and psychology. Women are underrepresented in computer science and engineering– which are the higher paying fields. There have been pushes in recent years to have more women in STEM fields, but the these graphs do not reveal any notable increase in women where there is not a corresponding increase in men, ie. more people are majoring in that field, not only women. We also see that the number of men is constant in the fields they are underrepresented in.\nComputer science, biological and biomedical sciences, and mathematics and statistics are increasing in popularity, while English, Philosophy and Religion, and Education are decreasing in popularity.\nIn 2018, Boston University and Wheelock College merged together to create a school with the research and doctoral programs from BU’s School of Education and the early childhood education and specialized pedagogy of Wheelock in one program. Following the merger, the number of education degrees awarded decreased.\nBefore the merger, BU offered an array of majors related to education, including a BS in Deaf Studies, BS in Early Childhood Education, BS in Elementary Education, BS in English Education, BS in Mathematics Education, BS in Science Education, BS in Social Studies Education, BS in Special Education, and a BS in Foreign Language Education. In Fall of 2022, BU consolidated all of these majors into the BS in Education & Human Development, which then has tracks based on student interests, and clearly focused in on the Master’s and EdD programs in education rather than the Bachelors programs that Wheelock College was known for. Furthermore, the number of Master’s degrees awarded in Education remains around five times the number of Bachelor’s degrees awarded in Education.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\n\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.CID.01.csv\")\n\nmaster_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(Year, contains(\"Master\"))\n\nmaster_long &lt;- master_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to = \"Group\", values_to = \"Count\") %&gt;%\n  separate(Group, into = c(\"Gender\", \"Degree\", \"Field\"), sep = \"\\\\. \") %&gt;%\n  filter(Degree == \"Master\")\nMASPLOT &lt;- ggplot(master_long, aes(x = Year, y = Count, color = Gender)) +\n  geom_line(size = 0.5) +\nscale_color_manual(values = c(\n  \"Women\" = \"#905acd\",\n  \"Men\" = \"#20B2AA\" \n)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Field, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Master Degrees by Field and Gender\",\n       y = \"Number of Degrees\",\n       x = \"Year\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n    theme(\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 6)\n  )\n\nggplotly(MASPLOT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of the same trends are present for Master’s Programs, but there are some discrepancies.\nOne of the notable differences is in the Business, Management, and Marketing CID code. After being renamed from School of Management (SMG) to Questrom School of Business in 2015, the branding and marketing for programs has transitioned, which may explain the visibly exponential increase in Master’s students in Business programs. The slogan “Questrom Means Business” is omnipresent in and out of BU, with advertisements on the MBTA and on sponsored Google searches. The Part-Time Flex MBA is growing in popularity, and is something that BU is clearly pushing for more students in, especially since the curriculum is accessible for working professionals!\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\n\n\n\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"Stu.CID.01.csv\")\n\n\nlong_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -Year,\n    names_to = \"Category\",\n    values_to = \"Count\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  separate(Category, into = c(\"Gender\", \"DegreeType\", \"Field\"), sep = \"\\\\. \", extra = \"merge\") \n\nlong_data_clean &lt;- long_data %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Count))\n\nsummed_field_year &lt;- long_data_clean %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, Field) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Total = sum(Count, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\ntotal &lt;- ggplot(summed_field_year, aes(x = Year, y = Total, color = Field)) +\n  geom_line(size = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Trends in Degrees Awarded by Field\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Degrees Awarded\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(total)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany fields have not changed in popularity over time; yet some have increased and decreased with societal pressures.\nWe see that the stereotypically “high paying” fields are increasing the most. As BU’s cost of tuition has increased, the return on investment is a key piece in deciding where to go to college. With a degree that is perceived as less valuable, it is more difficult to justify the high tuition rates. Yet, with a degree in Business, Biology, Engineering, and Computer Science, high salaries are more likely. Computer Science in particular has seen a drastic increase. In 2006, 255 degrees were awarded in Computer Science in 2023, 1093 degrees were awarded. CS is also currently the largest major in the College of Arts & Sciences!\nEducation is the only field with a noted decrease.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe student body is diverse. In terms of where they call home, what they study, what they identify as, and what path they are on, BU brings together many different students under the same goal of spreading knowledge.",

    "text": "This project is limited by the data available. There is both too much data to sift through and, at the same time, not enough. The project relied on IPEDS data, which is a robust collection of information, but not without its shortcomings. The main issue I encountered with this dataset is the lack of consistent longitudinal data collection. Many key categories—such as faculty gender—changed their methods of collection and categorization at a certain point, making it difficult to trace trends across those methodological shifts. Also, the gender is always divided into men and women, despite many individuals identifying otherwise. Additionally, some information I hoped would go back further in time—like tuition data—simply did not. Historically, data becomes more sparse and more difficult to find the further back you go, especially when focusing on a specific topic or institution.\nI’m an amateur when it comes to data visualization. I took a few courses a couple of years ago, but I don’t have experience working with large datasets or advanced visualization methods beyond the beginner-friendly “ggplot2” library. I also acknowledge my own bias in this project: shaped by preconceived notions about the university and the “propaganda” I’ve encountered as both a BU student and staff member. BU presents its most positive sides to the public and student body, while inconvenient facts are often hidden away. This makes research even more challenging, as the narrative is primarily controlled by those who want the university to look good. Stories are told by university spokespeople. Achievements and milestones are filtered through official publications. History is curated on university websites and in university-authored books. The only thing that cannot lie—and cannot hide—is the data."

The pool of women eligible to become full professors was limited, and given the amount of time and expertise needed to successfully proceed through the tenure and promotion process, it follows that there would be a smaller population of female tenured faculty members at the university.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\n\n\nfaculty_data &lt;- read.csv(\"F.Sal.80.csv\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_data)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                \"^Number\\\\.of\\\\.full\\\\.time\\\\.instructional\\\\.(faculty|staff)\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4})_.*\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor).*\",\n                \"Number_\\\\3_\\\\4_\\\\2\") \ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                \"^Average\\\\.salary\\\\.of\\\\.full\\\\.time\\\\.instructional\\\\.(faculty|staff)\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4})_.*\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor).*\",\n                \"Average_\\\\3_\\\\4_\\\\2\") \n\n\ncolnames(faculty_data) &lt;- colnames_cleaned\n\n\nlong_data &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Average\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Average_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"salary\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\n\n\n\n\nlong_count &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Number\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Number_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\n\nlong_combined &lt;- left_join(long_data, long_count, by = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"))\n\n\ngender_count_data &lt;- long_combined %&gt;%\n  filter(gender %in% c(\"women\", \"men\")) %&gt;%\n  select(year, rank, gender, n)\n\ngender_count_plot &lt;- ggplot(gender_count_data, aes(x = year, y = n, color = gender, group = gender,\n                                                   text = paste(\"Year:\", year,\n                                                                \"&lt;br&gt;Count:\", n))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~rank) +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Faculty by Gender from 1980-2011\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Faculty Count\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"women\" = \"#993366\", \"men\" = \"#5d437c\")) +\n  theme_few()\n\n\ninteractive_gender_plot &lt;- ggplotly(gender_count_plot, tooltip = \"text\")\n\ninteractive_gender_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in 1979, the number of PhDs awarded per year would reach 95,631, soon to hit six digits from which it would never again decrease. Steadily and consistently, the percentage of female PhD recipients would increase from 29.0% in 1980 to then exceed 50% in 2006. Women are predicted to be the majority of PhD recipients in projections.\nYet, the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon is evident here. Women are remaining as junior faculty and the tenured faculty positions remain predominantly male. We can see a push to hire women at the assistant professor level beginning in around 2015. Yet, the tenure process is typically 6-7 years, so we would expect to see that the number of female associate professors begins to increase in around 2020. Evidently, women are not achieving tenure, despite nearly a double in the number of assistant professors who are women, which could be attributed to those individuals not being retained or due to possible biases or issues with the tenure process.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n\nfaculty_curr &lt;- read.csv(\"F.Num.Curr.csv\")\n\n\n\ncolnames(faculty_curr) &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames(faculty_curr), \"_RV\", \"\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_curr)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames(faculty_curr), \"\\\\.{1,}\", \"_\") \n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned, \"^_|_$\", \"\")\n\ncolnames(faculty_curr) &lt;- colnames_cleaned\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    \"(S)(\\\\d{4})_IS_Full_time_instructional_professors\",\n                                    \"\\\\2_Professor\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    \"(total|men|women)_(Grand|American_Indian_or_Alaska_Native|Asian|Black|Hispanic|NHPI|White|Two|Unknown)\",\n                                    \"\\\\2_\\\\3_\\\\1\")\n\n\n\n\n# Ensure it's in the desired format\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    \"(S)(\\\\d{4})\",\n                                    \"\\\\2\")\n# Replace race/ethnicity terms with abbreviations, including Two and Unknown\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    c(\"American_Indian_or_Alaska_Native\" = \"AIAN\",\n                                      \"Black_or_African_American\" = \"Black\",\n                                      \"White\" = \"White\",\n                                      \"Asian\" = \"Asian\",\n                                      \"Hispanic_or_Latino\" = \"Hispanic\",\n                                      \"Native_Hawaiian_or_Other_Pacific_Islander\" = \"NHPI\",\n                                      \"Two_or_more_races\" = \"Two\",\n                                      \"Race_ethnicity_unknown\" = \"Unknown\"))\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_curr) %&gt;%\n  #

However, at Boston University in that moment, there were internal and external forces at play. President Robert A. Brown entered his tenth year as the tenth president of the university with a robust new Strategic Plan in place.\nThe 2015 strategic plan aimed to transform the university into a world-class research institution, and the items all included faculty improvement goals.\nThis includes\n\nBig Thinking Meets Big Reality\n“We had to figure out what would really make a difference to the University, to the students, to the world. Then break it down into realistic actions. Like hiring more professors—amazing people who inspire amazing people.”\nFooting the Bill\n“We’re halfway through the timeline of our first-ever, $1B comprehensive fundraising effort, and… we’re closer to our goal than we expected: over $800M to date. Among other things, these funds are… attracting and retaining world-class faculty.”\nChartering Success\n“There are a lot of ways to describe our progress… There’s our hiring and mentoring of the next generation of award-winning professors and researchers.\nBeing Better than Just Great\n“Aside from making it easier for our undergraduates to move between colleges, and bringing more diversity on both sides of the lectern, we’re committed to ongoing, rigorous academic reviews of all our offerings, focusing on the quality of our educational programs, faculty, and research.”\nMapping our Progress\n“We created 94 new faculty positions and dropped our student/faculty ratio from 15:1 to 12.5:1”\n\nBU also was invited to join the prestigious Association of American Universities in 2012, which likely made the university hold itself to higher standards in order to continue to be mentioned in the save breath as institutions such as Harvard, Brown, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and the like\n\n\nSalary Discrepancies\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- long_combined %&gt;%\n  filter(gender != \"total\")\n\n\n\np_salary &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = salary, color = gender, group = gender,\n                                      text = paste(\"Year:\", year,\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;Salary:\", scales::label_dollar()(salary),\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;n:\", n))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~rank) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary from 1980-2010\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Salary\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"women\" = \"#993366\", \"men\" = \"#5d437c\", \"total\" = \"#6fa9b8\")) +\n  theme_few() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) \n\ninteractive_salary_plot &lt;- ggplotly(p_salary, tooltip = \"text\")\n\ninteractive_salary_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nfaculty_data &lt;- read.csv(\"F.Sal.16.csv\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_data)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(\n  colnames_cleaned,\n  \"^Instructional\\\\.staff\\\\.on\\\\.9\\\\.\\\\.10\\\\.\\\\.11\\\\.or\\\\.12\\\\.month\\\\.contract\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4}).*\\\\.\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor)\\\\.\",\n  \"Number_\\\\2_\\\\3_\\\\1\"\n)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(\n  colnames_cleaned,\n  \"^Average\\\\.salary\\\\.for\\\\.instructional\\\\.staff\\\\.on\\\\.9\\\\.month\\\\.contract\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4}).*\\\\.\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor)\\\\.\",\n  \"Average_\\\\2_\\\\3_\\\\1\"\n)\n\ncolnames(faculty_data) &lt;- colnames_cleaned\n\n\n\nlong_data &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Average\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Average_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"salary\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\nlong_count &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Number\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Number_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\n\nlong_combined &lt;- left_join(long_data, long_count, by = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"))\n\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- long_combined %&gt;%\n  filter(gender != \"total\")\n\np_salary &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = salary, color = gender, group = gender,\n                                      text = paste(\"Year:\", year,\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;Salary:\", scales::label_dollar()(salary),\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;n:\", n))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~rank) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary from 2016-2022\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Salary\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"women\" = \"#993366\", \"men\" = \"#5d437c\", \"total\" = \"#6fa9b8\")) +\n  theme_few() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\ninteractive_salary_plot &lt;- ggplotly(p_salary, tooltip = \"text\")\n\ninteractive_salary_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe salary averages for women vs men has women consistently below the average.

It is hard to say that there is discrimination at play in this scenario, primarily because of the lesser amount of seniority and years of merit and salary increase to boost the average of the gender. Women only recently have been receiving PhDs at the same rate as men, so I anticipate that as faculty retire, the salaries will level out.\n\n\nRacial Demographics\n\n\nCode\nlong_faculty_race &lt;- faculty_curr %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -instnm,\n    names_to = \"key\",\n    values_to = \"n\"\n  )\n\nlong_faculty_race &lt;- long_faculty_race %&gt;%\n  separate(key, into = c(\"race\", \"gender\", \"year\", \"rank\"), sep = \"_\", remove = FALSE)\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race %&gt;%\n  filter(gender != \"NA\", race != \"NA\", rank != \"Unknown\")\n\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(!str_detect(key, \"Grand\"))  # Remove rows with 'Grand'\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race_clean %&gt;%\n  mutate(rank = case_when(\n    str_detect(key, \"Professor\") ~ \"Professor\",\n    str_detect(key, \"Associate\") ~ \"Associate\",\n    str_detect(key, \"Assistant\") ~ \"Assistant\",\n    TRUE ~ rank \n  )) %&gt;%\n  separate(key, into = c(\"race\", \"gender\", \"year\", \"rank\"), sep = \"_\") \n\n\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race %&gt;%\n  filter(gender == \"total\") \n\n\nstackedrace &lt;- ggplot(long_faculty_race_clean, aes(x =year , y = n, fill = race)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  facet_wrap(~rank) + \n  labs(title = \"Faculty Count by Race and Rank from 2012-2022\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Faculty\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"AIAN\" = \"#006400\",\n                              \"Black\" = \"#4B0082\",\n                              \"White\" = \"#003366\",\n                              \"Asian\" = \"#800080\",\n                              \"Hispanic\" = \"#800000\",\n                              \"NHPI\" = \"#2F4F4F\", \n                              \"Two\" = \"#008080\")) +\n  theme_few() + scale_x_discrete(breaks = function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), by = 2)])+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\ninteractive_plot &lt;- ggplotly(stackedrace)\ninteractive_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace categorizations changed in the IPEDS system around 2010, so the data collection changed during that year. However, the recent data conveys that higher education continues to be pervasively white. Despite Boston University being founded on the principles of “inclusion, regardless of gender, race, or religion,” having Black and Japanese Law graduates as early as 1877, naming Howard Thurman as the first Black dean in a predominantly white university in 1953, graduating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr with a PhD in 1955, launching the Center for Antiracist Research in 2020, and currently having a black, female president, Dr. Melissa Gilliam, BU’s faculty demographics have evolved minimally and are not reflective of the United States population. The leaky pipeline is clear. The junior faculty are (marginally) more diverse than the tenured faculty.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe see much change at the assistant professor level, which bodes well for the future of higher education. More diverse people are being welcomed into academia, and now the challenge is to foster an inclusive climate in order to retain the exceptional scholars hired at the university.",

We live in a society where prestige and selectivity is more important than educational quality and personal “fit.” Every year, schools get more selective and acceptance rates drop, much to the delight of the institutions who are eager to flaunt their low acceptance rates. Yet, this is because more students are applying to universities, all of whom competing for a small number of spots. Many highly capable students are being rejected, not due to their merit, but due to the large volume of applications. To this end, the college admissions process has become less about working hard and getting good grades, and more about gaming the system in order to stand out among an ocean of other applicants with good grades.\n\n\nGender\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(readr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\n\ndf &lt;- read_csv(\"Adm.Num.01.csv\")\n\ndf_clean &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  rename(year = x1)\n\n\n\ndf_gender_long &lt;- df_clean %&gt;%\n  select(year,\n         applicants_men, applicants_women,\n         admissions_men, admissions_women,\n         enrolled_men, enrolled_women) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -year,\n    names_to = c(\"category\", \"gender\"),\n    names_sep = \"_\",\n    values_to = \"number\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    category = case_when(\n      category == \"applicants\" ~ \"Applicants\",\n      category == \"admissions\" ~ \"Admissions\",\n      category == \"enrolled\"   ~ \"Enrollments\",\n      TRUE ~ category\n    ),\n    gender = case_when(\n      gender == \"men\" ~ \"Men\",\n      gender == \"women\" ~ \"Women\",\n      TRUE ~ gender\n    ))\n\ndf_rates &lt;- df_clean %&gt;%\n  transmute(\n    year,\n    admissions_rate_men   = admissions_men / applicants_men,\n    admissions_rate_women = admissions_women / applicants_women,\n    yield_rate_men        = enrolled_men / admissions_men,\n    yield_rate_women      = enrolled_women / admissions_women\n  )\nadmit_long &lt;- df_rates %&gt;%\n  select(year, admissions_rate_men, admissions_rate_women) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -year, names_to = \"group\", values_to = \"rate\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Metric = \"Admissions Rate\",\n    Gender = ifelse(group == \"admissions_rate_men\", \"Men\", \"Women\")\n  )\nyield_long &lt;- df_rates %&gt;%\n  select(year, yield_rate_men, yield_rate_women) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -year, names_to = \"group\", values_to = \"rate\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Metric = \"Yield Rate\",\n    Gender = ifelse(group == \"yield_rate_men\", \"Men\", \"Women\")\n  )\ndf_long_rates &lt;- bind_rows(admit_long, yield_long)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(df_long_rates, aes(x = factor(year), y = rate, fill = Gender)) +\ngeom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9))+\n  facet_wrap(~Metric) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1), limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Women\" = \"#c73e4e\", \"Men\" = \"#5d437c\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Admissions and Yield Rates by Gender\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"Gender\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a period of time between 2001 and 2017, acceptance rates were always higher for women. In recent years, this has flipped, while the university’s yield predictions have been rather stable. For women, the acceptance rate peaked in 2011 at ~60% and was at its lowest 15% in 2021 (based on this dataset). In just 10 years, the acceptance rate has quartered!\n\n\nCode\ndf_admit &lt;- select(df_long, year, applicants_men, applicants_women)\n\ndf_admit_long &lt;- df_admit %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(applicants_men, applicants_women),\n               names_to = \"Gender\",\n               values_to = \"Count\")\na &lt;- ggplot(df_admit_long , aes(x = factor(year), y = Count, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Applicants Over Time by Gender\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Applicants\",\n       fill = \"Gender\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"applicants_men\" = \"#5d437c\", \"applicants_women\" = \"#c73e4e\")) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\nggplotly(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the number of women applying to BU is significantly higher than the number of men, with the difference increasing over time.

This large class is graduating this year, in 2025, and the size of the class has led to tickets being required at commencement for the first time. However, there were more students enrolled in the 2011 class, so it is a bit odd that the university has stressed that the class of 2025 is enormous when in it in line with the class sizes of the 2000s.\n\n\nConclusions\nCollege admissions are becoming more complicated and more competitive. Women are dominating admissions and acceptances, and the process is becoming more challenging to navigate!",

    "text": "This project seeks to show how Boston University has changed over the past few decades using publicly available data. By visualizing data on demographics, salaries, personnel numbers, and finances—and situating these trends within the context of the university’s history and broader world events—we can begin to understand the patterns that emerge, as well as raise new questions about what the institution’s history may be concealing. Understanding why and how these trends occur helps us better grasp the movements of higher education more broadly. Knowing where BU has been allows us to start imagining where it’s headed, and this project demonstrates the power of data and communication in shaping the future of the university."

    "text": "As a former student of Boston University and current administrator at Boston University, much of my life has been spent within the BU community. I know the policies like the back of my hand, I can name every HUB requirement, I have a breadth of connections with colleagues across the university, and I spend my days and evenings helping others connect with the institution in the ways I have. I can recite Boston University’s pitch (WORLD-CLASS R1 RESEARCH INSTITUTION) and why it is special, and I can repeat the various accomplishments (FIRST WOMAN PHD! MARTIN LUTHER KING JR!!). However, this project showed me what BU is beyond the narrative. While it is important to know the proud history of the institution you are affiliated with, being able to see long-term trends will specifically help me in various capacities of my job. I can see now that women are not obtaining tenure and can support our faculty in their tenure and promotion cases. I can see the tuition increase and the subsequent rise in financial aid and can communicate that to students. I can perceive the BU community from a bird’s-eye view and bring that knowledge into my everyday interactions.\nFor a long time, much of the information about BU has been conveyed to me through the grapevine and through anecdotes—a student sharing that their aid package wasn’t enough, a staff member saying that female faculty aren’t being retained, or a graduate student sharing that they feel unsupported and are leaving the program. These are not secrets—they’re available on IPEDS in number form and just need to be organized into graphs in order to pull back the mask on BU."

    "text": "Using publicly available Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) records, this project visualizes trends and movement at Boston University over the past few decades. Through statistical visualization, this project examines changes in gender and racial demographics among faculty and students, admissions patterns, financial considerations, completion rates, and degrees categorized by CIP codes, among other factors. By comparing these numerical trends to the university’s history, prominent contemporaneous events, and BU’s self-representation, this project provides a holistic, yet data informed picture of Boston University from around 1980 to the present. The objective of this project is to examine how numerical values are interpreted and explained through trends and events in higher education, and how we can use these trends to begin institutional conversations about where we have come from, where we are now, where we are going, and what we can do to change the university’s trajectory."
