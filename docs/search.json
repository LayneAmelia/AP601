    "text": "This project is limited by the data available. There is both too much data to sift through and, at the same time, not enough. The project relied on IPEDS data, which is a robust collection of information, but not without its shortcomings. The main issue I encountered with this dataset is the lack of consistent longitudinal data collection. Many key categories—such as faculty gender—changed their methods of collection and categorization at a certain point, making it difficult to trace trends across those methodological shifts. Additionally, some information I hoped would go back further in time—like tuition data—simply did not. Historically, data becomes more sparse and more difficult to find the further back you go, especially when focusing on a specific topic or institution.\nI’m an amateur when it comes to data visualization. I took a few courses a couple of years ago, but I don’t have experience working with large datasets or advanced visualization methods beyond the beginner-friendly “ggplot2” library. I also acknowledge my own bias in this project: shaped by preconceived notions about the university and the “propaganda” I’ve encountered as both a BU student and staff member. BU presents its most positive sides to the public and student body, while inconvenient facts are often hidden away. This makes research even more challenging, as the narrative is primarily controlled by those who want the university to look good. Stories are told by university spokespeople. Achievements and milestones are filtered through official publications. History is curated on university websites and in university-authored books. The only thing that cannot lie—and cannot hide—is the data."

This section focuses on gender and racial demographics in tenured and tenure-track faculty by rank in terms of number, and salary averages based on gender.\n\nGender Demographics\nBefore 1980, there were 34,390 female PhD recipients in the US compared to 144,208 male PhD recipients. The pool of women eligible to become full professors was limited, and given the amount of time and expertise needed to successfully proceed through the tenure and promotion process, it follows that there would be a smaller population of female tenured faculty members at the university.\n\n\nCode\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(stringr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(dplyr)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(ggthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(hrbrthemes)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(scales)))\n\n\nfaculty_data &lt;- read.csv(\"F.Sal.80.csv\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_data)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                \"^Number\\\\.of\\\\.full\\\\.time\\\\.instructional\\\\.(faculty|staff)\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4})_.*\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor).*\",\n                \"Number_\\\\3_\\\\4_\\\\2\") \ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                \"^Average\\\\.salary\\\\.of\\\\.full\\\\.time\\\\.instructional\\\\.(faculty|staff)\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4})_.*\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor).*\",\n                \"Average_\\\\3_\\\\4_\\\\2\") \n\n\ncolnames(faculty_data) &lt;- colnames_cleaned\n\n\nlong_data &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Average\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Average_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"salary\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\n\n\n\n\nlong_count &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Number\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Number_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\n\nlong_combined &lt;- left_join(long_data, long_count, by = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"))\n\n\ngender_count_data &lt;- long_combined %&gt;%\n  filter(gender %in% c(\"women\", \"men\")) %&gt;%\n  select(year, rank, gender, n)\n\ngender_count_plot &lt;- ggplot(gender_count_data, aes(x = year, y = n, color = gender, group = gender,\n                                                   text = paste(\"Year:\", year,\n                                                                \"&lt;br&gt;Count:\", n))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~rank) +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Faculty by Gender from 1980-2011\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Faculty Count\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"women\" = \"#993366\", \"men\" = \"#5d437c\")) +\n  theme_few()\n\n\ninteractive_gender_plot &lt;- ggplotly(gender_count_plot, tooltip = \"text\")\n\ninteractive_gender_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in 1979, the number of PhDs awarded per year would reach 95,631, soon to hit six digits from which it would never again decrease. Steadily and consistently, the percentage of female PhD recipients would increase from 29.0% in 1980 to then exceed 50% in 2006. Women are predicted to be the majority of PhD recipients in projections.\nYet, the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon is evident here. Women are remaining as junior faculty and the tenured faculty positions remain predominantly male. We can see a push to hire women at the assistant professor level beginning in around 2015. Yet, the tenure process is typically 6-7 years, so we would expect to see that the number of female associate professors begins to increase in around 2020. Evidently, women are not achieving tenure, despite nearly a double in the number of assistant professors who are women.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n\nfaculty_curr &lt;- read.csv(\"F.Num.Curr.csv\")\n\n\n\ncolnames(faculty_curr) &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames(faculty_curr), \"_RV\", \"\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_curr)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames(faculty_curr), \"\\\\.{1,}\", \"_\") \n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned, \"^_|_$\", \"\")\n\ncolnames(faculty_curr) &lt;- colnames_cleaned\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    \"(S)(\\\\d{4})_IS_Full_time_instructional_professors\",\n                                    \"\\\\2_Professor\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    \"(total|men|women)_(Grand|American_Indian_or_Alaska_Native|Asian|Black|Hispanic|NHPI|White|Two|Unknown)\",\n                                    \"\\\\2_\\\\3_\\\\1\")\n\n\n\n\n# Ensure it's in the desired format\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    \"(S)(\\\\d{4})\",\n                                    \"\\\\2\")\n# Replace race/ethnicity terms with abbreviations, including Two and Unknown\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames_cleaned,\n                                    c(\"American_Indian_or_Alaska_Native\" = \"AIAN\",\n                                      \"Black_or_African_American\" = \"Black\",\n                                      \"White\" = \"White\",\n                                      \"Asian\" = \"Asian\",\n                                      \"Hispanic_or_Latino\" = \"Hispanic\",\n                                      \"Native_Hawaiian_or_Other_Pacific_Islander\" = \"NHPI\",\n                                      \"Two_or_more_races\" = \"Two\",\n                                      \"Race_ethnicity_unknown\" = \"Unknown\"))\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_curr) %&gt;%\n  #

However, at Boston University in that moment, there were internal and external forces at play. President Robert A. Brown entered his tenth year as the tenth president of the university with a robust new Strategic Plan in place.\nThe 2015 strategic plan aimed to transform the university into a world-class research institution, and the items all included faculty improvement goals.\nThis includes\n\nBig Thinking Meets Big Reality\n“We had to figure out what would really make a difference to the University, to the students, to the world. Then break it down into realistic actions. Like hiring more professors—amazing people who inspire amazing people.”\nFooting the Bill\n“We’re halfway through the timeline of our first-ever, $1B comprehensive fundraising effort, and… we’re closer to our goal than we expected: over $800M to date. Among other things, these funds are… attracting and retaining world-class faculty.”\nChartering Success\n“There are a lot of ways to describe our progress… There’s our hiring and mentoring of the next generation of award-winning professors and researchers.\nBeing Better than Just Great\n“Aside from making it easier for our undergraduates to move between colleges, and bringing more diversity on both sides of the lectern, we’re committed to ongoing, rigorous academic reviews of all our offerings, focusing on the quality of our educational programs, faculty, and research.”\nMapping our Progress\n“We created 94 new faculty positions and dropped our student/faculty ratio from 15:1 to 12.5:1”\n\nBU also was invited to join the prestigious Association of American Universities in 2012, which likely made the university hold itself to higher standards in order to continue to be mentioned in the save breath as institutions such as Harvard, Brown, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and the like\n\n\nSalary Discrepancies\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- long_combined %&gt;%\n  filter(gender != \"total\")\n\n\n\np_salary &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = salary, color = gender, group = gender,\n                                      text = paste(\"Year:\", year,\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;Salary:\", scales::label_dollar()(salary),\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;n:\", n))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~rank) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary from 1980-2010\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Salary\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"women\" = \"#993366\", \"men\" = \"#5d437c\", \"total\" = \"#6fa9b8\")) +\n  theme_few() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) \n\ninteractive_salary_plot &lt;- ggplotly(p_salary, tooltip = \"text\")\n\ninteractive_salary_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nfaculty_data &lt;- read.csv(\"F.Sal.16.csv\")\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- colnames(faculty_data)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(\n  colnames_cleaned,\n  \"^Instructional\\\\.staff\\\\.on\\\\.9\\\\.\\\\.10\\\\.\\\\.11\\\\.or\\\\.12\\\\.month\\\\.contract\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4}).*\\\\.\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor)\\\\.\",\n  \"Number_\\\\2_\\\\3_\\\\1\"\n)\n\ncolnames_cleaned &lt;- str_replace_all(\n  colnames_cleaned,\n  \"^Average\\\\.salary\\\\.for\\\\.instructional\\\\.staff\\\\.on\\\\.9\\\\.month\\\\.contract\\\\.(men|women|total)\\\\.\\\\.SAL(\\\\d{4}).*\\\\.\\\\.(Professor|Associate\\\\.professor|Assistant\\\\.professor)\\\\.\",\n  \"Average_\\\\2_\\\\3_\\\\1\"\n)\n\ncolnames(faculty_data) &lt;- colnames_cleaned\n\n\n\nlong_data &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Average\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Average_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"salary\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\nlong_count &lt;- faculty_data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Number\"), \n               names_to = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"),\n               names_pattern = \"Number_(\\\\d{4})_(.*)_(.*)\", \n               values_to = \"n\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\n\nlong_combined &lt;- left_join(long_data, long_count, by = c(\"year\", \"rank\", \"gender\"))\n\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- long_combined %&gt;%\n  filter(gender != \"total\")\n\np_salary &lt;- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = year, y = salary, color = gender, group = gender,\n                                      text = paste(\"Year:\", year,\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;Salary:\", scales::label_dollar()(salary),\n                                                   \"&lt;br&gt;n:\", n))) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~rank) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary from 2016-2022\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Salary\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"women\" = \"#993366\", \"men\" = \"#5d437c\", \"total\" = \"#6fa9b8\")) +\n  theme_few() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\ninteractive_salary_plot &lt;- ggplotly(p_salary, tooltip = \"text\")\n\ninteractive_salary_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe salary averages for women vs men has women consistently below the average.

It is hard to say that there is discrimination at play in this scenario, primarily because of the lesser amount of seniority and years of merit and salary increase to boost the average of the gender. Women only recently have been receiving PhDs at the same rate as men, so I anticipate that as faculty retire, the salaries will level out.\n\n\nRacial Demographics\n\n\nCode\nlong_faculty_race &lt;- faculty_curr %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -instnm,\n    names_to = \"key\",\n    values_to = \"n\"\n  )\n\nlong_faculty_race &lt;- long_faculty_race %&gt;%\n  separate(key, into = c(\"race\", \"gender\", \"year\", \"rank\"), sep = \"_\", remove = FALSE)\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race %&gt;%\n  filter(gender != \"NA\", race != \"NA\", rank != \"Unknown\")\n\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race_clean %&gt;%\n  filter(!str_detect(key, \"Grand\"))  # Remove rows with 'Grand'\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race_clean %&gt;%\n  mutate(rank = case_when(\n    str_detect(key, \"Professor\") ~ \"Professor\",\n    str_detect(key, \"Associate\") ~ \"Associate\",\n    str_detect(key, \"Assistant\") ~ \"Assistant\",\n    TRUE ~ rank \n  )) %&gt;%\n  separate(key, into = c(\"race\", \"gender\", \"year\", \"rank\"), sep = \"_\") \n\n\n\nlong_faculty_race_clean &lt;- long_faculty_race %&gt;%\n  filter(gender == \"total\") \n\n\nstackedrace &lt;- ggplot(long_faculty_race_clean, aes(x =year , y = n, fill = race)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") + \n  facet_wrap(~rank) + \n  labs(title = \"Faculty Count by Race and Rank from 2012-2022\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Number of Faculty\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"AIAN\" = \"#006400\",\n                              \"Black\" = \"#4B0082\",\n                              \"White\" = \"#003366\",\n                              \"Asian\" = \"#800080\",\n                              \"Hispanic\" = \"#800000\",\n                              \"NHPI\" = \"#2F4F4F\", \n                              \"Two\" = \"#008080\")) +\n  theme_few() + scale_x_discrete(breaks = function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), by = 2)])+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\ninteractive_plot &lt;- ggplotly(stackedrace)\ninteractive_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace categorizations changed in the IPEDS system around 2010, so the data collection changed during that year. However, the recent data conveys that higher education continues to be pervasively white. Despite Boston University being founded on the principles of “inclusion, regardless of gender, race, or religion,” having Black and Japanese Law graduates as early as 1877, naming Howard Thurman as the first Black dean in a predominantly white university in 1953, graduating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr with a PhD in 1955, launching the Center for Antiracist Research in 2020, and currently having a black, female president, Dr. Melissa Gilliam, BU’s faculty demographics have evolved minimally and are not reflective of the United States population. The leaky pipeline is clear. The junior faculty are (marginally) more diverse than the tenured faculty.\n\n\nConclusions\nWe see much change at the assistant professor level, which bodes well for the future of higher education. More diverse people are being welcomed into academia, and now the challenge is to foster an inclusive climate in order to retain the exceptional scholars hired at the university.",

    "text": "This project seeks to show how Boston University has changed over the past few decades using publicly available data. By visualizing data on demographics, salaries, personnel numbers, and finances—and situating these trends within the context of the university’s history and broader world events—we can begin to understand the patterns that emerge, as well as raise new questions about what the institution’s history may be concealing. Understanding why and how these trends occur helps us better grasp the movements of higher education more broadly. Knowing where BU has been allows us to start imagining where it’s headed, and this project demonstrates the power of data and communication in shaping the future of the university."

The reflection depicts one’s beliefs of the implications of the historical research for present-day practice.\n\nAs a former student of Boston University and current administrator at Boston University, much of my life has been spent within the BU community. I know the policies like the back of my hand, I can name every HUB requirement, I have a breadth of connections with colleagues across the university, and I spend my days and evenings helping others connect with the institution in the ways I have. I can recite Boston University’s pitch and why it is special, and I can repeat the various accomplishments"

    "text": "Using publicly available Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) records, this project visualizes trends and movement at Boston University over the past few decades. Through statistical visualization, this project examines changes in gender and racial demographics among faculty and students, admissions patterns, financial considerations, completion rates, and degrees categorized by CIP codes, among other factors. By comparing these numerical trends to the university’s history, prominent contemporaneous events, and BU’s self-representation, this project provides a holistic, yet data informed picture of Boston University from around 1980 to the present. The objective of this project is to examine how numerical values are interpreted and explained through trends and events in higher education, and how we can use these trends to begin institutional conversations about where we have come from, where we are now, where we are going, and what we can do to change the university’s trajectory."
